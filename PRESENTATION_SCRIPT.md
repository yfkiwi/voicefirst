# Community Grant Assistant - Presentation Script

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**Audience:** Community leaders, funding organizations, technical stakeholders  
**Version:** Prototype v1.0 - October 2025

---

## üéØ INTRODUCTION (1-2 minutes)

### Opening Statement

"Good morning/afternoon. Today I'm excited to share with you the **Community Grant Assistant** ‚Äì an AI-powered tool designed specifically to help small northern and Indigenous communities prepare competitive grant proposals."

### The Problem

"Many small communities face significant barriers when applying for funding:

- **Limited capacity**: Small staff teams wearing multiple hats
- **Complex requirements**: Grant applications can be 20-30 pages with technical language
- **Knowledge gaps**: Understanding what funders are looking for
- **Time constraints**: Proposals take 40-80 hours to prepare from scratch
- **Resource challenges**: Many communities lack dedicated grant writers

**The result?** Great community projects never get funded because the application process is too overwhelming."

### The Solution

"The Community Grant Assistant uses **RAG technology** ‚Äì Retrieval Augmented Generation ‚Äì to analyze your community's own documents, learn about funding programs, and help you write proposals that align perfectly with funder priorities.

Think of it as having an experienced grant writer who knows your community intimately, working alongside you 24/7."

## üè† LANDING PAGE WALKTHROUGH (2 minutes)

### Visual Design

*[Show landing page]*

"Let me walk you through the interface. You'll notice:

- **Warm, natural color palette**: Sand beige, cedar brown, Arctic blue ‚Äì colors that feel welcoming and culturally appropriate
- **Large, clear buttons**: Designed for low-bandwidth environments and varying technical comfort levels
- **Plain language**: No jargon. Every instruction is clear and conversational
- **Readable typography**: 16-18px body text for accessibility"

### Two Clear Pathways

*[Point to the two main cards]*

"Communities can start their proposal journey in two ways:

**PATH 1: Upload Existing Draft**
- 'I've already started a draft, but I need help improving it'
- The AI will analyze what you have and suggest improvements
- Perfect for communities with partial applications

**PATH 2: Start From Scratch**
- 'I need to build a complete proposal with AI guidance'
- Step-by-step guidance through all 12 sections
- The system we'll focus on today"

### Indigenous-Friendly Design

"Every design choice respects the communities we serve:
- Offline-first mindset for low-bandwidth areas
- Desktop-first layout for community office computers
- Cultural sensitivity in colors and language
- Built with input from northern and Indigenous communities"

## üìÑ DOCUMENT UPLOAD - SECTION 0 (2 minutes)

*[Click 'Start From Scratch']*

### The RAG Foundation

"Before we start writing, we need to give the AI context. This is **Section 0: Upload Documents** ‚Äì the foundation of our RAG system."

*[Show the dual upload interface]*

### Community Documents (Blue Section)

"On the left, you can upload **Community Documents**:

- Comprehensive Economic Development plans
- Economic diversification strategies
- Community needs assessments
- Previous grant applications
- Any reports about your community

*[Demonstrate file upload]*

The AI will extract:
- Key demographics and statistics
- Community strengths and assets
- Historical challenges
- Strategic priorities
- Past successes

**This ensures proposals reflect YOUR community's reality, not generic templates.**"

### Funding Guidelines (Amber Section)

"On the right, upload **Funding Program Documents**:

- Grant application guidelines
- Eligibility criteria
- Scoring rubrics
- Program priorities
- Sample successful applications

*[Demonstrate file upload]*

The AI learns:
- What the funder values most
- Mandatory vs. optional elements
- Scoring criteria and weighting
- Language and terminology they prefer
- Common mistakes to avoid

**This ensures perfect alignment with funder expectations.**"

### The AI Context Panel

*[Point to purple info box]*

"The system shows exactly how it uses these documents:
- Extracts community context automatically
- Identifies funding alignment opportunities
- Provides smart, contextual suggestions
- Powers voice assistance with relevant knowledge

**More documents = Better assistance.** But they're optional ‚Äì you can proceed without uploads if needed."

---

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKER (1 minute)

*[Show progress bar and section bubbles]*

"The **Progress Tracker** keeps you oriented through all 12 sections:

- **Visual progress bar**: See completion percentage in real-time
- **Section bubbles**: Click any section to jump directly
- **Color coding**: 
  - Green = Current section
  - Light green = Completed sections
  - Gray = Upcoming sections
- **Document icon** (üìÑ): Reminds you that Section 0 is your RAG foundation

This is especially helpful when working on proposals over multiple sessions ‚Äì you always know where you are and what's left."

## ü§ñ AI CHAT PANEL - THE MAGIC (3-4 minutes)

*[Focus on the AI Chat Panel]*

"Now let me show you the **AI Assistant** ‚Äì this is where the magic happens."

### Context Awareness

*[Point to the top indicator]*

"The AI always knows:
- **What section you're working on**: Provides section-specific guidance
- **Your uploaded documents**: 'üìö RAG Context: 3 community docs, 2 funding docs'
- **Your workflow stage**: Different assistance for draft improvement vs. new proposals

This isn't a generic chatbot ‚Äì it's **your personalized grant writing partner**."

### Text Chat

*[Show the message interface]*

"You can type questions like:
- 'What should I include in the executive summary?'
- 'How do I make my objectives more specific?'
- 'What evidence would strengthen this section?'
- 'Can you suggest outcome indicators?'

The AI responds with:
- Specific guidance based on YOUR community docs
- Alignment tips from the funding guidelines you uploaded
- Best practices from successful grant applications
- Plain language explanations"

### Voice Chat - Three Modes

*[Show the three voice buttons]*

"Voice assistance is designed for accessibility and efficiency:

**üé§ Hold to Speak (Left button)**
- Press and hold to record your thoughts
- Release to process
- Perfect for: 'I want to talk through my project idea'

**üî¥ Record Message (Middle button)**
- Click to start, click to stop
- Longer, more detailed recordings
- Perfect for: Explaining complex community situations

**üëÇ Voice Mode (Right button)**
- Continuous conversation mode
- AI speaks responses back to you
- Perfect for: Hands-free work sessions"

### Auto-Fill from Voice

*[Demonstrate the Hold to Speak feature]*

"Here's something powerful ‚Äì **voice-to-form auto-fill**:

*[Click Hold to Speak, simulate recording]*

'When I release this button, watch what happens...'

*[Show fields auto-populating]*

The AI:
1. Transcribes your voice (using ElevenLabs API - integration ready)
2. Understands which section you're in
3. Extracts relevant information
4. Populates the appropriate fields automatically
5. Uses context from your uploaded documents

**Example:** In the Budget section, you could say:

'We need $75,000 total with $50,000 from this grant. Personnel is $40,000 for two coordinators, equipment is $15,000 for computers and tools, and training is $20,000 for skills development workshops.'

*[Fields auto-fill]*

Boom. Budget populated in seconds."

### Smart Section Guidance

*[Show different sections]*

"The AI provides **section-specific prompts**:

**Cover Page:** 'What would you like to call your project?'

**Problem Statement:** 'Tell me about the challenge your community is facing. I can help you articulate this clearly.'

**Budget:** 'Let's work through your budget categories. What are your major expenses?'

**Outcomes:** 'What positive changes do you hope to see? I can help you make these measurable.'

Every section gets tailored guidance based on grant writing best practices and your specific context."

### Document Context Integration

*[Point to the RAG context indicator]*

"Because you uploaded documents, the AI can:

- Pull population statistics from your CED plan
- Reference specific community strengths from your reports
- Quote relevant passages from funding guidelines
- Ensure alignment with both community priorities AND funder requirements

**This is the power of RAG** ‚Äì grounding AI responses in YOUR actual documents, not hallucinated information."
